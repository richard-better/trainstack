# trainstack

This project was created with [Better-T-Stack](https://github.com/AmanVarshney01/create-better-t-stack), a modern TypeScript stack that combines Astro, Hono, ORPC, and more.

## Features

- **TypeScript** - For type safety and improved developer experience
- **Astro** - The web framework for content-driven websites
- **TailwindCSS** - Utility-first CSS for rapid UI development
- **Hono** - Lightweight, performant server framework
- **oRPC** - End-to-end type-safe APIs with OpenAPI integration
- **workers** - Runtime environment
- **Drizzle** - TypeScript-first ORM
- **Cloudflare D1** - Database engine
- **Authentication** - Better-Auth
- **Vite+** - Unified Vite toolchain, workspace task runner, linting, and formatting

## Getting Started

Use Bun 1.4.2 and Node.js 22.20.0, matching CI. Then install the dependencies:

```bash
bun install
```

## Database Setup

This project uses Cloudflare D1 (SQLite) with Drizzle ORM.

Runtime database access uses the Cloudflare `DB` binding from `packages/infra/alchemy.run.ts`. If a local `DATABASE_URL` is present, it is only for database tooling.

Alchemy provisions the D1 database and applies migrations during `deploy`.

1. Generate migration files:

```bash
bun run db:generate
```

Then, run the development server:

```bash
bun run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:4321](http://localhost:4321) in your browser to see the web application.
The API is running at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

## Environment Configuration

Each app owns its environment schema in `.env.schema`. Varlock generates `src/env.ts` during installation; run `bun run env:generate` after changing a schema. Commit schemas, and keep secrets in ignored env files or your deployment platform.

Import the generated `ENV` accessor in application code. Shared database and auth packages receive configuration or initialized clients from the application. See [Varlock's monorepo guide](https://varlock.dev/guides/monorepos/).

For Cloudflare, Alchemy loads and validates deployment inputs with `varlock/auto-load` in its Node/Bun deployment process. Worker code reads native bindings; web clients use the framework's public env API through `src/env.public.ts` where needed. Alchemy supplies resource URLs and managed database credentials. In-Worker Varlock protections are deferred until an official Alchemy integration is available; see [the non-Wrangler deployment guidance](https://varlock.dev/integrations/cloudflare/#non-wrangler-deploy-tools-alchemy-sst-pulumi).

Bun's automatic env loading is disabled in `bunfig.toml`; the framework integration or server bootstrap loads Varlock. Node deployments must include Varlock and its dependencies alongside the app schema.

Run standalone Node/Bun tools that use Varlock from the owning app directory so they load that app's schema and env files. `env:generate` only generates TypeScript files; it does not initialize environment values in a subsequent command.

## Deployment

The infrastructure lives in [`packages/infra/alchemy.run.ts`](packages/infra/alchemy.run.ts). Alchemy manages the frontend and API Workers, D1 database and migrations, Astro session KV namespace, custom domains with DNS/TLS, and Axiom dataset and ingest token. Deployment state is stored remotely with `Cloudflare.state()`, shared by local deployments and CI.

Production uses `trainstackhq.com` for the frontend and `api.trainstackhq.com` for the API. Alchemy supplies the frontend API URL, API auth URL, and trusted frontend origin. Non-production stages use local or `workers.dev` URLs. The production D1 database is retained when removed from the stack or destroyed; Alchemy stops tracking a retained resource, so preserve its ID before a teardown.

[`Check and deploy`](.github/workflows/deploy.yml) checks pull requests targeting `main`. Every push to `main`, including a merged pull request, runs checks, Workers/D1 integration tests, and the backend build before deploying the complete `production` stack. Production deployments are serialized, running deployments are not cancelled, and older revisions are skipped if `main` has advanced. A manual workflow run is also supported from `main`.

See [`docs/deployment.md`](docs/deployment.md) for account-token permissions, GitHub production secrets, initial setup, migration and recovery procedures.

```bash
bun run plan:production
bun run deploy:production
```

## Git Hooks and Formatting

- Optional native Vite+ hooks: `bun run hooks:setup`
- Docs: [Vite+ commit hooks](https://viteplus.dev/guide/commit-hooks)
- Run checks: `bun run check`
